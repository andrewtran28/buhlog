# Buhlog (/bla:g/)
A showcase for a simple blog website called Buhlog (pronounced the same as "blog"). The Buhlog project consists of a monorepo containing both frontend and backend capabilties. The website allows for users to view the posts written by the author (me) using a HTML rich text editor. Other features include user authentication, commenting on posts, and saving draft posts (as an author).

This project's back-end framework was initially developed using Node.js and Express to allow for server and database blog functionalities. However, to challenge myself and learn a new framework, I have also re-create the entire back-end using the Flask framework written in Python. Both back-end servers co-exist and are virtually identical --Even sharing the same PostgreSQL database.
